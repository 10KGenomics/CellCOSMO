# pipeLine configuration Documentation

#Note:
; The current configuration file has 9 sections, the `global` section's option can used for all other sections.
; so you need to config these options, some of these parameters have a default assignment mechanism,
; so you can level these options empty such as [global.outdir | global.sample | global.thread | global.genomeDir]
; some of these parameters have [required] annotation on themselves,
; which must be configuration, such as [global.fq1 | global.fq2].
; There is one thing you need to know:
; the program will use the `global.genomeDir` parameter to determine whether to run star index step.
; More detailed description please see the annotation on themselves.
; Another you need to know is barcode section operation:
; In step of the barcode split step, there are two modes, one of them is split barcode
; with parametric mode which need provided `barcode.chemistry_config`, in the mode,you
; can configuration the valid params such as `barcode`,`linke`,`polyt` and `qual`,another
; mode is nonparametric mode, which you only can valid `polyt` and `qual`. the more detailed
; information you can view the annotation on themselves;

; Quality trimming of reads using two-color chemistry (NextSeq).
; Some Illumina instruments use a two-color chemistry to encode the four bases.
; This includes the NextSeq and the NovaSeq.
; In those instruments, a `dark cycle` (with no detected color) encodes a G.
; However, dark cycles also occur when sequencing `falls off` the end of the fragment.
; The read then contains a run of high-quality, but incorrect `G` calls at its 3' end.
nextseq_trim=20
; Since Cutadapt allows partial matches between the read and the adapter sequence,
; short matches can occur by chance, leading to erroneously trimmed bases.
; For example, roughly 0.25 of all reads end with a base that is identical to the first base of the adapter.
; To reduce the number of falsely trimmed bases, the alignment algorithm requires that
; at least {overlap} bases match between adapter and read.
